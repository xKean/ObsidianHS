- I can create a link so by adding  \[\[\]\] around a word. When clicking on it, it will automatically create a new page.

I like this since its from [[05.04.2023]]

### [[Obsidian Links |Links]] 
- Literature Note
- Reference a Concept
- Quote - Things
- We can add a # at the End of a Link to add some heading after it (visual only)
- We can add a ! before the beginning of a Link to show the actual text within
	- We can add a ^ before the end of the Link to show a specific paragraph
	- We can add a # before the end of the Link to show a specific heading including its contents

## Hashtag:

#WhatAHashtagIs We can explain what a hashtag is with this.
If we search for the hashtag we find every document and part where its used.
Its just as we would expect it to work.
We can organize them by using / for example #WhatAHashtagIs/HowToOrganize :). We can see all the Hashtags in a organized way right here:

## Links VS Hashtags
### When to use [[Obsidian Links]]?
- A Chapter of Knowledge
- Topics, Conecpts, Research Articles
- Example: "Mister Beast", "AI", "Obsidian Links", "Coding in C#"

### When to use #[[Obsidian Hashtags]]?
- Its for searching and finding mostly
- Categorize notes and contents
- Categories "with intent"
- Example: "#toNote", "#ToDo", "#c#", "#mathe2", "#prog/c#", "#uni/prog1"
- Think about yourself searching this in the future. Use with brain.

## Zettelkasen
- Fleeting Note = Daily Note
	- Raw Ideas, not distilled -> "daily Notes"

	- Notizen über Meetings, Sachverhalte, Termine etc. die nicht in Daily Notes landen sollen.


## Suchen mit Obisidan

- Kann wörter wie "OR" nutzen
- Beispiel:
	- "Parry OR Alli"
	- "Parry -alli" (ohne alli)
- Begriffe aus der Suche können einfach rausgezogen werden um einen Link zu erstellen
- Path: => Sucht nach Dateiname
- Quick Switcher: Ctrl+ O
- Kann Regex
- Wenn man etwas immer suchen will kann man ```query``` nutzen.
